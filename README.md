∗ Developed a Line Encoder and Scrambler Program.
∗ Utilized 5 line encoding schemes (NRZ-L, NRZ-I, Manchester, Differential Manchester, AMI) and 2 scrambling techniques
(HDB3, B8ZS).
∗ Created an intuitive web page with interactive input fields for custom input and random input generation.
∗ Generated encoded signals and displayed them using charts, along with the Longest Palindromic substring.
